Given that the working directory is bigApp, and the following directory structure:

bigApp
 |-- classes
 |      |-- com
 |          |-- wickedlysmart
 |-- source
       |-- com
            |-- wickedlysmart
                      |-- BigAppClass2.java

And the code:

1. public class BigAppClass2 { int doMore() { return 17; } }

And the following command-line invocations:

I. javac -d source/com/wickedlysmart/BigAppClass2.java
II. javac -d classes source/com/wickedlysmart/BigAppClass2.java
III. javac -d classes/com/wickedlysmart source/com/wickedlysmart/BigAppClass2.java

Which are true? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Invocation I will compile the file and place the .class file in the bigApp directory.

B. Invocation II will compile the file and place the .class file in the classes directory.

C. Invocation I will compile the file and place the .class file in the wickedlysmart directory.

D. Invocation II will compile the file and place the .class file in the wickedlysmart directory.

E. Invocation III will compile the file and place the .class file in the wickedlysmart directory.
