Given:

2. class Chilis {
3. Chilis(String c, int h) { color = c; hotness = h; }
4. String color;
5. int hotness;
6. public boolean equals(Object o) {
7. if(this == (Chilis)o) return true;
8. return false;
9. }
10. public String toString() { return color + " " + hotness; }
11. }

If instances of class Chilis are to be used as keys in a Map,
 which are true? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Without overriding hashCode(), the code will not compile.

B. As it stands, the equals() method has been legally overridden.

C. It’s possible for such keys to find the correct entries in the Map.

D. It’s NOT possible for such keys to find the correct entries in the Map.

E. As it stands, the Chilis class legally supports the equals() and hashCode() contracts.

F. If hashCode() was correctly overridden, it would make retrieving Map entries 
   by key easier.
