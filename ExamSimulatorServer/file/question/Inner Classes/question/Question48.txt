Given:

3. public class Baskin {
4. public static void main(String[] args) {
5. int i = 4;
6. int j = 1;
7.
8. assert(i > Integer.valueOf(args[0]));
9. assert(j > Integer.valueOf(args[0])): "error 1";
10. assert(j > i): "error 2": "passed";
11. } }

And, if the code compiles, given the following two command-line invocations:

I. java -ea Baskin 2
II. java -ea Baskin 0

Which are true? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Compilation fails.

B. Invocations I and II will throw an AssertionError that will add String data to the
   program’s execution log.

C. Invocations I and II will throw an AssertionError that will add String data to the
   program’s stack trace.

D. Not all of the assert statements use assertions appropriately.
