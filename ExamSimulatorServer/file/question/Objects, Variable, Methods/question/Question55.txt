Which are true? (Choose all that apply.)

A. X should be the file name of the JAR file, and Y should be "office".

B. X should be "office", and Y should be the file name of the JAR file.

C. Specifying a file name of the JAR file here is optional.

D. If a file name is not specified here, a file named office.jar will be created.

E. The file name, if specified, must be ended with .jar extension.

F. It is required that the "office" directory must initially have a subdirectory called
   "META-INF".
